first thing i've noticed is the players health is 4 bytes
while the dragon health is 1 byte

I thought about maybe going negative on the players health to achieve some sort of godmode but that won't work cause the instruction jg is being used which is signed comparasion 

That also means that there's a signed check on the dragons health.
So for the first stage you'll have to be a priest and die once to get a mama dragon. 
then you just use a shield and clarity as much as you can to get the dragon to 128 health which is 0x80 and negative when signed: 0b10000000

the signed check will then fail and you will beat the mama dragon
also after performing PriestAttack and defeating the dragon the dragon object gets freed.

and the player name gets allocated to 16 bytes which is just the size of the dragon object.

i guess we'll overwrite it with the address of the system("/bin/sh");


for some reason my script doesn't work out of the box...
maybe i need to allocate more dragons for my allocation to land inside.

so knight
knight
knight
priest
knight 
knight
knight 
priest
